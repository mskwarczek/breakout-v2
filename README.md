# Breakout!

[See it online](http://www.breakout2.mskwarczek.pl)

This is a second version of my [Breakout! game](https://github.com/mskwarczek/breakout-game).<br>
Frontend is made with React.js, backend with Express. Core game files are made with pure JS without additional frameworks.

Type `npm run dev` in the project directory to run this app.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode (with use of React `npm start`, port 3000) AND simultaneously runs server on different port (5000).<br>
This is the recommended way to test this app.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
